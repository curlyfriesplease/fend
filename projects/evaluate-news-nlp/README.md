# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
'Meaningmate' is a simple text sentiment analysis app.
It serves no purpose other than as an exercise for Udacity.com's Front End Developer course.

## Instructions
Input a line or paragraph of text into the input field. When submitted, you will be shown the AI analysis of its sentiment, irony, agreement, subjectivity, and the AI's confidence in its analysis.

## Data Sources
__MeaningCloud__ is used to analyse data.
__Loading.io__ provides the loading indicator.

## Installation
The dependencies for this project would not work with Node v16. The solution is, unfortunately, to install Node v14.
Run: npm i --legacy-peer-deps
